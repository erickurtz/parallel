1. [wave1d]

The program 'wave1d.c' in directory wave1d performs a simulation of a
wave moving through a string.  It solves a discretized version of the
1d wave equation.  The algorithm is similar to that of diffusion1d,
except that the update function requires the TWO previous time-steps,
not just one previous time-step.  For this reason, 3 copies of the
solution arrays need to be maintained.

Create a CUDA version named 'wave1d.cu'.  Parallelize the UPDATE
routine only.

Use configuration 'config0' with no output (wstep=0) to evaluate 
the best performance improvement of your CUDA implementation.
And the time cost should be reported as a comment in the first line 
of the CUDA file as:

// Cuda execution time: XXXXX sec.

Additionally, you will have to update the given Makefile with rules 
for testing your implementation.

Submit: wave1d.cu, Makefile, config*.txt (all config txt files)
